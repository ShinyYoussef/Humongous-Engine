only compiled shaders will be here.
they will be added automatically.
their source is the shaders directoy, in the same layer as the Assets directory

if you want to add a custom shader, add it to the shaders directory.
if you add any shaders in here yourself, they won't be automatically compiled, the asset manager will only detect compiled shaders
